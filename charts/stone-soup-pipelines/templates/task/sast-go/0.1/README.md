# sast-go task (Skipped)

## Description:

The sast-go task makes use of the GoSec tool, which is a type of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool that is specifically designed to analyze Go programming language code for potential security vulnerabilities.

This helps in identifying a wide range of security issues, including buffer overflows, SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other types of code injection attacks. By analyzing the code during the development phase, the GoSec tool can help identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development process, when they are less costly to fix.

> NOTE: This task is currently skipped.
