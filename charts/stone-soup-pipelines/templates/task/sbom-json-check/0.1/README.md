# sbom-json-check task

## Description:

The sbom-json-check task verifies the integrity and security of a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) file in JSON format using the CyloneDX tool.

The syntax of the sbom-cyclonedx.json file (found in the `/root/buildinfo/content_manifests/` directory) is checked using the CyloneDX tool, which is being led by longtime security community leader Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). CycloneDX is a self-defined “lightweight SBOM standard designed for use in application security contexts and supply chain component analysis.”
